# Lyon-Metro-Route-Construction
This project implements the A* algorithm to find efficient routes in the Lyon metro. The A* algorithm is a heuristic search technique that finds the shortest path between an initial node and a goal node.
Project Structure
main.py: Contains the main code of the project, including the definition of the Lyon metro graph, the implementation of the A* algorithm, and the graphical user interface.

Select an origin station and a destination station on the map.
Choose the time you wish to travel.
The application will compute the optimal route and display it on the map.
Dependencies
